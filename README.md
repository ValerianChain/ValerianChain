# ValerianChain

ValerianChain is an in-progress experimental integration between GrinCoin (MimbleWimble Protocol), RavenCoin (x16R algo & Assets) and DashCoin (Masternodes) with the aim to becomes DogeCoin Competitor. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes the first set of choices:

  * MimbleWimble Protocol: Great privacy, anonymity and scaling characteristics.
  * x16R algo: A unique mining algorithm which is ASIC resistance by design.
  * Masternodes: Powerful servers backed by collateral.
  * Relatively fast block time: 15 seconds.
  * Proof of Works, Proof of Stakes, and Masternodes.
